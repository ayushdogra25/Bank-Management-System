The Bank Management System program in C is a simple yet effective way to simulate basic banking operations. It is designed to allow users to create accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check account balances. The program makes use of several important C programming concepts, including structures, arrays, functions, loops, and conditional statements. The core component of the program is the BankAccount structure, which stores essential information about each account, such as the account number, account holder's name, and current balance. By grouping related data using a structure, the program efficiently manages multiple accounts.

An array of BankAccount structures is used to store up to 100 different accounts, making it possible to handle multiple users. The program is divided into specific functions for each banking operation. These functions include creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking balances. Each function is modular and performs a specific task, which makes the program more organized, reusable, and easy to understand. For example, the createAccount function gathers information from the user and stores the account details, initializing the balance to zero, while functions like deposit and withdraw modify the balance according to user inputs.

The program begins by displaying a menu, allowing the user to choose an action. Depending on the user's input, the corresponding function is executed. The menu continues to display until the user chooses to exit, which is controlled by a do-while loop. Conditional statements such as switch and if-else are used to handle the user's choices and check whether the operations are valid. For example, when depositing or withdrawing money, the program first checks if the account exists and ensures that there is sufficient balance for withdrawal. Overall, the program is a straightforward application of basic programming concepts, making it a suitable project for beginners learning C language and demonstrating how different components of a program work together to perform complex tasks.

The Bank Management System program is a simple implementation of a banking application using the C programming language. This program allows users to perform essential banking operations such as creating new accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the balance of existing accounts. The core concept behind the program is the use of a structure called BankAccount that holds key information for each bank account, including the account number, account holder’s name, and the current balance. By defining a structure, we efficiently group related data for each account, allowing easy management of multiple accounts within the system.

An array of BankAccount structures is used to store the details of up to 100 accounts. This array functions as the primary storage unit where all account-related information is kept. Whenever an account is created, the new account data is appended to this array, ensuring that all operations—whether deposits, withdrawals, or balance checks—can be performed by accessing the appropriate index in the array. The use of functions in the program ensures that each operation, such as account creation, money deposit, or withdrawal, is handled separately. This modular approach to coding helps keep the program organized and ensures that each task can be reused or modified independently if needed.

The program’s flow is controlled by a menu-driven interface, where the user can select an option such as creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, checking the balance, or exiting the system. This menu is presented inside a do-while loop, ensuring that the program continues to run until the user explicitly chooses to exit. Based on the user's choice, a corresponding function is called to perform the specific operation. Conditional statements, such as switch and if-else, are used to evaluate the user’s input and guide the flow of the program. For example, if the user selects the deposit option, the system asks for the account number and amount to be deposited, verifies if the account exists, and then updates the balance accordingly.

In the case of withdrawals, the program ensures that users can only withdraw money if they have sufficient funds. If the amount to be withdrawn exceeds the account balance, an error message is displayed. Similarly, when checking the balance, the user is prompted to enter their account number, and if the account is found, the balance is displayed. By organizing the code with functions and arrays, the program achieves a structured, readable, and scalable system that performs basic banking tasks effectively. The logic of the program revolves around fetching and updating data from the accounts array based on user input, ensuring a seamless banking experience.
